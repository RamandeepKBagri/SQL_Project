# Design Database for Zoo
This project focuses on the zoo database designing. Initially before designing, zoo analysis is done with expert domain, here in our database designing domain expert is Prof Hellen, Golden gate University. Such analysis gave directions to have required specifications in the designing.

During analysis and planning, we came with following description of zoo and its architecture. Zoo have many animals and each animal is distinguished by animal ID. Each animal ID have one keeper. Keeper is the caretaker of the animal who feeds the animal. Keeper can have many animals to feed in the week. Each Keeper works 40 hours per week. Each keeper is assigned to the animal IDs that he has to feed in a day. Each keeper has to feed 4 animals in their shift. Animals live in their own cages. Cages are defined by size their cage IDâ€™s.
Then, there are different zoo locations with each type of animal entity define the location of each zoo. Adoption entity is the database for the record of those animals who are adopted and left the zoo. Adoption will help the zoo to keep track on animals for their protection and their own database and management queries. Care entity will be child entity for Keeper to keep the records of time and type of feeding of each animal by their keepers. Zoo Visitor can be assigned to ID from their identification scan Driver license number or any identification card.
